# LGCS108 Phonology

This course explores the study of sound patterns in language, focusing on how phonemes function within a particular linguistic system. Students will learn to analyze phonological structures, processes, and rules that govern sound patterns, including features like assimilation, dissimilation, and vowel harmony. Topics covered include phoneme inventories, syllable structure, stress patterns, tone, and the interaction between phonology and morphology. The course will also examine how phonological theories, such as generative phonology, autosegmental phonology, and optimality theory, have evolved over time and their application to both familiar and less-studied languages. Emphasis will be placed on understanding phonological patterns from both descriptive and theoretical perspectives, with hands-on exercises in transcription, analysis, and the application of phonological rules.
